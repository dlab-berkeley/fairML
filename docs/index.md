# Fairness and Bias in Machine Learning Workshop

**Overview**

This workshops provides a gentle introduction to the fairness and bias in machine learning applications with a focus on the ProPublica's Analysis of the COMPAS algorithm. We revised [the ProPublica's original R and Python code](https://github.com/propublica/compas-analysis/blob/master/Compas%20Analysis.ipynb) to increase its code readability, remixed it with other references, then published and deployed the revised notebook using bookdown and GitHub page.

**Outline** 

1. Bias in the data 
  - Risk of Recidivism Data
  - Risk of Violent Recidivism Data

2. Bias in the algorithm
