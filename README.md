You may either download the materials from this github page and follow along in your own version of RStudio, or you can click [this link](https://datahub.berkeley.edu/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fdlab-berkeley%2FfairML&urlpath=rstudio%2F&branch=master) to follow along in UC Berkeley's Datahub. Datahub is a campus resource that gives Berkeley affiliates access to a remote solution for working with popular programming languages like R or Python. After this workshop, you can always return to your work and even create new notebooks by visiting this [link](https://datahub.berkeley.edu/).

**Overview**

This workshops provides a gentle introduction to the fairness and bias in machine learning applications with a focus on the ProPublica's Analysis of the COMPAS algorithm. We revised [the ProPublica's original R and Python code](https://github.com/propublica/compas-analysis/blob/master/Compas%20Analysis.ipynb) to increase its code readability, remixed it with other references, then published and deployed the revised notebook using bookdown and GitHub page.

**Outline** 

1. Bias in the data 
  - Risk of Recidivism Data
  - Risk of Violent Recidivism Data

2. Bias in the algorithm
